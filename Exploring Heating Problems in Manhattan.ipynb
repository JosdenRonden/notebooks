In this notebook, you will be exploring the data, using Spark's SQL module and the visualization tool Brunel.\n\nDuring the months of October to May, residents of NYC can call 311 to report that a building doesn't have enough heat or hot water. In the remaining months, June to September, complaints can be made that heating has been left on. \n\nThere may be a number of different factors that contribute to heating complaints, you will select a few of the features available in the data to see if they suggest any correlation.\n\n***\n\n## Load the Necessary Packages\nFirst import the OS module which allows you to interface with the underlying operating system that Python is running on. Also import matplotlib which is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Pandas is the main library in Python for data analysis. And lastly, import and install the Brunel package which will be used to visualize the data. ",
